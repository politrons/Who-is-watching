This a total free open source tool. IÂ´m not responsable about how people might decide to modify it and use it.
Obiously this app is not persisting any personal informacion of any consumer aka credentials.
Is a really simple app, just to enjoy myself and learn a little bit about [Golang](https://golang.org/).
