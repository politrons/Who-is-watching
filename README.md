An open source tool to let you know who is watching your social networks.

### Use
In order to use this tool you just need to follow the simple next steps:

* Clone the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/politrons/Who-is-watching.git
```

``
* Paste in your browser the url, passing your facebook credentials.
```
http://localhost:8080/?username=**********&password=*******

* Now you will see with an interval of 1 second the people that has been watching your profile lately.

Just to be clear. This is a total free open source tool. I´m not responsable about how people might decide to modify it and use it.
Obiously this app is not persisting any personal informacion of any consumer aka credentials.
It´s just a really simple app, to enjoy myself and learn a little bit more about [Golang](https://golang.org/).
